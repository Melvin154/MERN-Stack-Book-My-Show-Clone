      "Hysterical Improv Comedy Show is an interactive show where an ensemble of Improvisers gets together to perform comedy scenes on the spot, based on suggestions from you, the audience. The genre can be comedy along with action, drama, romance, horror, mystery, tragedy, or really just anything that transpires during the show. Attempting to really tell you what the show is would be futile because there is really no script. You know like how every day we wake up and live life without a script? Except, you get to control this and can definitely expect to have a lot more fun and laughter here!",
